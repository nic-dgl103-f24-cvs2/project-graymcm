## Overall Issues & Updates Needed

### Footer
- Fix the **footer** layout to be more compact and responsive.

### Color Accessibility
- Adjust the website's color scheme, as the yellow color (`#fff000`) doesn't pass accessibility tests on **WEBAIM's Contrast Checker**.

### Background Image
- Add a proper **background image** for visual improvement.

### Logo Alignment
- Move the logo to the **left side** of the screen rather than having it placed on top of the navigation bar.

### Website Accessibility
- Improve accessibility by addressing the following:
  - **Layout Breakpoints**: Ensure the layout adapts well across devices.
  - **Viewport Scaling Issues**: Resolve any scaling issues that affect the display.
  - **Overflow/Clipping Issues**: Fix any content overflow or clipping problems.
  - **CSS Media Queries**: Implement responsive media queries to optimize the site for various screen sizes.

### Missing Alt Text
- Some images (like the logo and the header image) donâ€™t have appropriate **alt attributes**, which affects both **SEO** and **accessibility**. Ensure all images have descriptive alt text to improve accessibility for screen readers and search engine indexing.

### Non-semantic HTML Tags
- Some elements like `<div>` and `<span>` could be replaced with more **semantic tags** (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.) for better **accessibility** and **SEO**. Using semantic HTML improves code structure and allows search engines and assistive technologies to better interpret the content.
