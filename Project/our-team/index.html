            <!-- Written with CHATGPT -->
            <p>
              Emily had always been good with numbers. Growing up, she loved
              solving puzzles, and accounting seemed like the perfect fit. After
              finishing her degree, she landed her first job at a local firm,
              where she quickly earned a reputation for being meticulous and
              reliable. Outside of work, Emily enjoyed quiet nights with a good
              book or exploring new hiking trails. Though she was young, she
              dreamed of one day starting her own firm, helping small businesses
              manage their finances with the same care she had for her own.
